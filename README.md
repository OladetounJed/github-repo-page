## General info
This is my Submission for the Frontend Engineering Recuritment Test for Vesicash, It is my Gihub Repository Page Clone.
The project follows Block Element Modifier Naming Methodology for the CSS Class Naming.
I also made use of dotenv for the Environment Variables (Base URL) for protecting sensitive information incase the project grow bigger and other features are implemented.

I implemented Dark Mode Switch for the Product which allows User to toggle between the light mode and the dark mode.

Functions and variables name are self explanatory and I will add neccessary comments for easy and effective code review.
